## Description

2D data structure for efficiently comparing points distributed in a rectangular area. Comparing every point to every other point is O(n^2) time; using a QuadTree is much more efficient at O(log n) time. (See [QuadTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) for more.)

Built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
